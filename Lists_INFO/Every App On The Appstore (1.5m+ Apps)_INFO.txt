This makes sure logs are kept of apps that fail, so\nyou can purchase them later without redoing the whole list. It also\nmeans if you ever do another big list, it skips apps you already own.\n\nIf you have any legacy idevices, dont do this on the same Apple ID they\nuse. Long purchase lists dont load on old devices. Even if you dont have\nany old devices it is still recomended you do this on an alt account.\n\nThis list can take up to 20 days so if you have an old mac, leave it\nrunning on that.\n\nShould your computer turn off or the script be interrupted, you can\ncontinue from where you left of by pressing R on the main menu.\n\n${yellow}Page 1 of 2${none}",
	"page2": "${bold}${lightred}IMPORTANT! READ!${none}\n\nThere is no way to speed this up. Running multiple instances of\n\nthe script will cause all purchases to fail as Apple limits requests\nto one at a time. Meaning if you need to make a purchase on your phone\nyou should pause the script. Otherwise keep trying to purchase the app\non your phone, if you have logging on, apps that fail to purchase will\nbe added to a \"try again\" for later anyway.\n\n${bold}To pause the script at any time:${none}\n\nControl + Z | Then run the command \\\"fg\\\" to resume.\n\n${bold}Or${none}\n\nControl + C | Then re-run the script and press R on the main menu.\n\n${lightgreen}Good luck brave traveller, happy purchasing!${none}"
