Before starting it is HIGHLY recommended you enable logging via the
settings menu. This makes sure logs are kept of apps that fail, so
you can purchase them later without redoing the whole list. It also
means if you ever do another big list, it skips apps you already own.

If you have any legacy idevices, dont do this on the same Apple ID they
use. Long purchase lists dont load on old devices. Even if you dont have
any old devices it is still recomended you do this on an alt account.

This list can take up to 20 days so if you have an old mac, leave it
running on that.

Should your computer turn off or the script be interrupted, you can
continue from where you left of by pressing R on the main menu.

There is no way to speed this up. Running multiple instances of
the script will cause all purchases to fail as Apple limits requests
to one at a time. Meaning if you need to make a purchase on your phone
you should pause the script. Otherwise keep trying to purchase the app
on your phone, if you have logging on, apps that fail to purchase will
be added to a \"try again\" for later anyway.

${bold}To pause the script at any time:${none}

Control + Z // Then command \"fg\" to resume.

Control + C // Then re-run the script and press R on the main menu.
