# Insane iOS App Purchaser

A script to purchase apps in bulk.

(Name suggestions welcome)

## Why on earth would this be useful?

Apps are frequently removed from the appstore. Hence my thinking was, if I can purchase as many apps as possible, whenever an app is removed I can go download it later from my purchase list.

## Usage

Plase a file named "bundleIds.txt" in the same file as the script.
* It should be formatted the same as the following, one Bundle ID per line.
```
com.naturalmotion.clumsyninja
com.mediocre.smashhit
com.klgamesllc.escapechallenge
```

## Obtaining Bundle ID's
**As of 1.1 you can now use the built in lists!** Some Examples include:
- Every iOS 3 - iOS 6 app
- Internal Apple Apps (Soon)

Another script I've made hase multiple ways to get Bundle ID's: [Insane App Converter](https://github.com/disfordottie/insaneAppConverter)

## Credits
**majd** for making [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) which is what makes this script possible.
