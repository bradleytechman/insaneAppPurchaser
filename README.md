# Insane iOS App Purchaser

A script to purchase apps in bulk.

(Name suggestions welcome)

## Why on earth would this be useful?

Apps are frequently removed from the appstore. Hence my thinking was, if I can purchase as many apps as possible, whenever an app is removed I can go download it later from my purchase list.

## Usage

Plase a file named "bundleIds.txt" in the same file as the script.
* It should be formatted the same as the following, one Bundle ID per line.
```
com.naturalmotion.clumsyninja
com.mediocre.smashhit
com.klgamesllc.escapechallenge
```
