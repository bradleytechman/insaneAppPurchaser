# Insane iOS App Purchaser

A script to purchase apps in bulk.

(Name suggestions welcome)

## Why on earth would this be useful?

Apps are frequently removed from the appstore. Hence my thinking was, if I can purchase as many apps as possible, whenever an app is removed I can go download it later from my purchase list.

## Usage

Plase a file named "bundleIds.txt" in the same file as the script.
* It should be formatted the same as the following, one Bundle ID per line.
```
com.naturalmotion.clumsyninja
com.mediocre.smashhit
com.klgamesllc.escapechallenge
```

## How You Can Help
I made this script when I had a list of over 60k bundle id's but accidentally deleted it, meaning this script can't be used how I intended. I already have over 30k on my purchase list but stopped the script half way (My laptop needed to be restarted) and never got to turning it back on before the list was gone.

**Basically if you for some reason have, or know how, to get as many bundle id's as possible. It would be great.**
